---+++ Deleting a local and remote branch

When you are done with a branch, having merged its contents into another branch, saving a ``diff`` with ``git show``, or otherwise being totally over it, you need to delete your local branch first and then delete the remote branch.
<verbatim>
$ git branch -d -r refactor
Deleted branch refactor (was e4234ae).</verbatim>

An alternate method of deleting a remote branch is the following obscure command:
<verbatim>
$ git push origin :refactor</verbatim>

You can delete all unused local tracking branches with the prune command:
<verbatim>
$ git remote prune origin
Pruning origin
URL: git@raptor.cari.net:/opt/git/prisem.git
 * [pruned] origin/refactor
 * [pruned] origin/stats</verbatim>

"Deletes all stale remote-tracking branches under <name>. These stale branches have already been removed from the remote repository referenced by <name>, but are still locally available in "remotes/<name>".

With ``--dry-run`` option, report what branches will be pruned, but do not actually prune them."

---+++ Finding a string in a commit anywhere in the repo

   * [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5816134/finding-a-git-commit-that-introduced-a-string-in-any-branch][]]

There are times when you need to identify a commit that contains a string (or regular expression) in order to understand what is happening in some code. The command ``git show -S`` or <span>git show -G</span>will do this.
<verbatim>
[dittrich@localhost ansible-playbooks (dims-207)]$ git log -S sources_url
commit 2a4451636f4141c63db43df9e0b67031bdeac297
Author: eliot <eliot@uw.edu>
Date:   Tue Nov 4 15:53:45 2014 -0800

    added missing ansible variable sources_url

commit 28e28d19dbe31180d10caa1189140f84ed1f7e01
Author: Linda Colby <linda.colby@nextcentury.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 31 10:23:08 2014 -0400

    Removed sources that were moved to sources server. Updated task files to use sources server</verbatim>

Now that you have identified the commits that contain the string, use the first few characters of the hash with the <span>git show</span>command to see the diff of the commit:
<verbatim>
[dittrich@localhost ansible-playbooks (dims-207)]$ git show 28e28d19db

---+++ Step...

---+++ Managing Multiple Git Repositories

A useful tool for managing multiple Git repositories and keeping them in sync with the master branches is to use [[http://joeyh.name/code/mr/][mr]].

To track a repo with ``mr``, do the following:
<verbatim>
[dittrich@localhost ~]$ cd ~/git/ansible-inventory
[dittrich@localhost ansible-inventory (master)]$ mr register
Registering git url: git@git.devops.develop:/opt/git/ansible-inventory.git in /Users/dittrich/.mrconfig
[dittrich@localhost ansible-inventory (master)]$ mr update
mr update: /Users/dittrich/git/ansible-inventory
Already up-to-date.

mr update: finished (1 ok)</verbatim>

The following ``~/.mrconfig`` file can be used to bootstrap a bunch of the DIMS related repos. This is not a complete list of all DIMS repos, but serves to illustrate how ``mr`` maintains its list of repos to track when you do ``mr update``:
<verbatim>
[dittrich@localhost git]$ cat ~/.mrconfig 
[git/prisem]
checkout = git clone 'git@git.devops.develop:/opt/git/prisem.git' 'prisem'

[git/dims-sample-data]
checkout = git clone 'git@git.devops.develop:/opt/git/dims-sample-data.git' 'dims-sample-data'

[git/vagrant]
checkout = git clone 'git@git.devops.develop:/opt/git/vagrant.git' 'vagrant'

[git/ansible-playbooks]
checkout = git clone 'git@git.devops.develop:/opt/git/ansible-playbooks.git' 'ansible-playbooks'

[git/ansible-inventory]
checkout = git clone 'git@git.devops.develop:/opt/git/ansible-inventory.git' 'ansible-inventory'

[git/supervisor]
checkout = git clone 'git@git.devops.develop:/opt/git/supervisor.git' 'supervisor'

[git/mal4s]
checkout = git clone 'https://github.com/secure411dotorg/mal4s/' 'mal4s'

[git/dims-keys]
checkout = git clone 'git@git.devops.develop:/opt/git/dims-keys.git' 'dims-keys'</verbatim>

---+++ Linda's instructions on how to do Git and Jira dev branching:
<verbatim>
Suppose the ticket in JIRA is dims-193. Suppose the work you are doing is in ansible-playbooks.

1.   cd to your ansible-playbooks repo. Ensure you are on the dev branch. Update the repo if you haven't already (mr update)

2.   git checkout -b dims-193        -   this will create the branch and check it out. You can also do a  "git branch dims-193" and "git checkout dims-193" if you want to use 2 steps.

3.   git push origin dims-193        -  pushes the new branch to origin

4.   git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/dims-193 dims-193          -  this sets your local branch as a tracking branch of the remote

So, do the work in branch dims-193. Commit frequently 

To test Ansible, you are going to want to make sure that the change (if it is a change) works on an existing system. So I would do the following.

1.    Make sure you've committed your changes in the ansible-playbooks repo branch dims-193 and have pushed them to the origin (otherwise packer Makefile won't be able to get them). Command is "git push origin dims-193"

2.   cd to the packer repo.  Say you are going to call your server VM  ddsrv1  and workstation VM dddesktop1. The following command is an example - use the IP you want and the name you want.

3.   make PLATFORM``server 3D``off IP``192.168.56.32 NAME``ddsrv1 ANSIBLEPLAYBOOKSBRANCH=dev

This will start the creation of the server VM. By setting the ANSIBLEPLAYBOOKSBRANCH=dev, you are telling make to checkout the dev branch when it clones the ansible-playbooks repo.

4. Wait.....  When make finishes (check the output to see what variables were used and what other artifacts there are), cd to the vagrant run directory that was created. It should be as simple as:

cd ../vagrant-run-ddsrv1

However, make will tell you where your vagrant run directory is.

5.   In the vagrant run directory, do:

make up

This should run vagrant up, which creates the VM, starts it, and provisions it via Ansible. Note, you are provisioning via the dev branch of ansible-playbooks.

Ok, hopefully that will all work and you will get no errors...  Now you're going to provision the machine with your dims-193 branch of ansible-playbooks.

1.  cd back to packer directory.

2.  Run:

make NAME=ddsrv1 clean-playbooks

This will delete the ansible-playbooks repo in the vagrant run directory.

3.  Next, run:

make NAME``ddsrv1 ANSIBLEPLAYBOOKSBRANCH``dims-193 update-playbooks

This will clone the repo again to your vagrant run directory and check out dims-193.

4.  Go back to your vagrant run directory.

Now, you don't need to provision the entire server again. If you made changes in a couple roles,  common and cif-client for example, and you know there are not interdependencies, you can run:

TAG='common,cif-client'  make provision

and that will re-provision the server using the dims-193 branch of ansible-playbooks.

If you want to test the whole thing (to make sure your change didn't have unintended consequences in other roles) you could do:

make provision

and that will re-provision everything.

Now, you can create a desktop VM using the same methodology, except that PLATFORM=desktop.   I don't know how thorough we are going to want to be with these ansible tests - a change to cif-client should work identically on a desktop or a server, but I'll leave that up to others to decide. 

Now that you've got a server VM and a desktop VM created, you can continue to use them for other tests. If you need to start over with a fresh, unprovisioned VM, just do, in the vagrant run directory,

make destroy

and that will destroy the current vagrant VM created by the Vagrantfile in that directory.

I will put how to merge your change back into dev in another post.

Also, I need to update Jenkins to use the dev branch of Ansible-playbooks...  But you won't be running on Jenkins until your branch is merged back into dev.

I can tell you which Jenkins job should be run if one is needed (if the change to ansible-playbooks affects any of our deployed servers) if you don't know which one it is.

---++ Cleaning up a repo by removing large files (DANGEROUS!!!)

   * [[https://gist.github.com/aaronzirbes/4570924][This script will help you remove large files from your git repo history and shrink the size of your repository.]]
   * [[http://stevelorek.com/how-to-shrink-a-git-repository.html][How to Shrink a Git Repository]]

The [[http://stevelorek.com/how-to-shrink-a-git-repository.html][How to Shrink a Git Repository]] page was used to perform cleanup of the ``ansible-playbooks`` repo. The string ``filename`` needed to be substituted with the paths of the files to delete, which were identified by the script ``git-find-largest`` and edited with ``vi`` and ``awk`` to strip out just the paths. The following command was then used on the list:

<verbatim>
for f in `cat largest.txt`; do git filter-branch --tag-name-filter cat --index-filter "git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch $f" --prune-empty -f -- --all; done
</verbatim>

After that, the steps to clear the cache, do garbage collection and pruning, etc. were followed.

---++ (OLD AND POSSIBLY OBSOLETE) Dittrich notes on using Git

*NOTE:These are now potentially obsolete instructions. They were an initial attempt to teach people what I (Dittrich) was doing as I learned to use Git. These are now beginning to diverge from what the DIMS team has been using. They are here only for historic purposes as we clean up the instructions the team is supposed to be using. *
