================================
DIMS Developer Guide v |release|
================================

This document (version |release|) covers issues related to development
of DIMS components from a developer's perspective. It is related closely
to, and frequently cross-references, the :ref:`dimsciutils:dimsciutilities`
(``dims-ci-utils`` for short).

.. note::

   This is a `living document` that is being updated frequently to reflect
   current practices within the DIMS team.  As such, it may undergo
   restructuring frequently.

..

.. note::

   Throughout this document, ``warning::``, ``note::``, or other
   callout directives are used to let you know when to read carefully
   and be aware of things that might not be exactly up-to-date or
   safe for blind *cut+paste* into command lines.
